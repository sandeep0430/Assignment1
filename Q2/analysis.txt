After making these five visualizations, I understood my data much better. Here’s what each one helped me see:  

---

### **1. Math Scores Histogram**  
**What I learned:**  
- Most students got average scores (50-80).  
- Very few got very low or very high scores.  
- Math scores look balanced, with most students in the middle.  

**This helped me quickly see how students performed in math overall.**

### **2. Math Scores by Gender (Boxplot)**  
**What I learned:**  
- Males scored slightly higher than females.  
- Some females had very low math scores (outliers).  
- Both genders had a similar range of scores.  

**This made it easy to compare male and female math scores.**

### **3. Parental Education Level (Countplot)**  
**What I learned:**  
- Most students’ parents had "some college" or an "associate’s degree."  
- Very few had parents with a master’s degree.  
- This might mean parent education affects student scores.  

**This helped me see the education background of most students’ parents.**

### **4. Math vs. Reading Scores (Scatter Plot)**  
**What I learned:**  
- If a student is good at math, they are usually good at reading too.  
- The points make an upward pattern, showing a strong connection.  
- Females seem to have slightly higher reading scores than males.  

**This helped me see that students strong in math are also strong in reading.**

### **5. Writing Scores by Lunch Type (Violin Plot)**  
**What I learned:**  
- Students with free/reduced lunch scored lower in writing.  
- Students with standard lunch had higher scores overall.  
- Some students in both groups had very high scores, but more low scores were in the free/reduced group.  

**This made it easy to see that students from lower-income families might struggle more.**

### **Final Conclusion**  
These charts made it much easier to see patterns in the data instead of looking at numbers. I could quickly compare groups, find trends, and understand relationships. Without these visualizations, it would have been harder to analyze the data.
